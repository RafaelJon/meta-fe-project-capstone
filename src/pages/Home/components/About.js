            We are a family owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on
            traditional recipes served with a modern twist. In 2003, Mario and
            Adrian, used the balance of their savings and cashed in their
            retirement accounts to purchase the Squeeze In, a 45-seat breakfast
            caf√© in Truckee, CA. With no restaurant experience, they put it all,
            and then some, on the line.
